# Computer Graphics Drawing and Clipping Algorithms 🎨🚀 

Welcome to the fantastic world of computer graphics, where pixels become art and code unleashes creativity! 🌈✨ This repository is a treasure trove of C++ programs crafted for the wild and exciting journey through the Computer Graphics course. Get ready for a rollercoaster of graphics magic! 🎢🚀 

## Programs Showcase 🚀 

Dive into the enchanting collection of programs, each written with love and caffeine in the C++ language using the OpenGL library: 

1. **DDA Line Drawing** 
2. **Bresenham Line Drawing** 
3. **Bresenham Circle Drawing** 
4. **Midpoint Circle Drawing** 
5. **Midpoint Ellipse Drawing** 
6. **2-D Transformation** 
7. **3-D Transformation** 
8. **Cohen-Sutherland Outcode Line Clipping Algorithm** 
9. **Liang-Barsky Algorithm** 
10. **Cyrus–Beck Line Clipping** 
11. **Sutherland-Hodgman Polygon Clipping Algorithm** 
12. **Weiler–Atherton Clipping Algorithm** 

All programs are designed to run in a window of 640x480 pixels, offering a pixel-perfect experience. 🖼️💻 Custom-defined functions have been meticulously crafted for the sole purpose of these assignments. 

## Colorful Adventures 

🌈 Behold the vibrant color code standard that brings life to each program: 

- **BLACK/WHITE:** Normal line segment/window 
- **RED LINE:** Clipped line segment 
- **BLUE LINE:** Unclipped/Rejected line segment 
- **RED FILL COLOR:** Accepted Polygon Area 
- **RED OUTLINE:** (Especially for Weiler Atherton) Accepted outlines from a Polygon 

In the magical world of 2-D Transformations: 
- **RED POLYGON:** Initial Polygon 
- **BLUE POLYGON:** Transformed Polygon 

3-D Transformations unveil a multi-colored coding for each face, making identification a breeze. The Z-axis's invisible dance has not been pseudo-displayed but adds a touch of mystery to the graphics spectacle. 

## Ready, Set, Execute! 💻🚀 

To embark on these graphics adventures, compile and run with the following terminal command: 

```bash g++ your_filename.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLEW -lGLU -o fileout ./fileout ``` 

Get ready to witness the magic unfold before your eyes! 🌟🎉 Happy coding and may the pixels be ever in your favor! 🚀🎨
